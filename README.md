# DSC180A_A02 Group 3 (Methodology 7)

- Note: This specific branch (methodology_7) is used to showcase current work as well as demonstrating the test target.

This project aims to understand obstacle avoidance and path planning. Data is generated using ROS packages in conjucntion with the Intel Realsense D435i/D455 camera.
The resulting output will yield rosbag files which will need to be transformed for exploratory data analysis. Transforming the data generated from the camera is part of the data pipeline process. In this methodology, I will demonstrate this transformation of data from ".bag" data into ".csv" data.
